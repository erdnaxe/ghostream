  #  - rtmp://live-cdg.twitch.tv/app/STREAM_KEY
  #  - rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/STREAM_KEY

## Prometheus monitoring ##
# Expose a monitoring endpoint for Prometheus
monitoring:
  # You should not expose monitoring metrics to the whole world.
  # To limit access to only localhost, use 127.0.0.1:2112
  #listenAddress: :2112

## SRT server ##
# The SRT server receive incoming stream and can also serve video to clients.
srt:
  # To limit access to only localhost, use 127.0.0.1:9710
  #listenAddress: :9710

  # Max number of active SRT connections
  #maxClients: 64

## Web server ##
# The web server serves a WebRTC player.
web:
  # Web page favicon, can be .ico, .png or .svg
  #
  #favicon: /static/img/favicon.svg

  # Server name seen by users
  # If example.com reverses to this server, then change to example.com
  #
  #hostname: localhost

  # To limit access to only localhost, use 127.0.0.1:8080
  #
  #listenAddress: :8080

  # Web site name
  # Put something cool here, such as "Cr@ns Stream"
  #
  #name: Ghostream

  # Use the domain name as the stream name
  # e.g., on http://example.com:8080/ the stream served will be "example.com"
  # This implies that your domain will be able to serve only one stream.
  #
  #oneStreamPerDomain: false

  # Refresh period for viewer stats (below the player)
  #
  #viewersCounterRefreshPeriod: 20000

  # Add a web page as a side widget
  # This can be a public TheLounge or Element instance to make a chat.
  # You can use {{.Path}} to include current stream name,
  # e.g. https://example.com/stream_{{.Path}}
  #
  #widgetURL: ""

## WebRTC server ##
webrtc:
  # UDP port range used to stream
  # This range must be opened in your firewall.
  #
  #minPortUDP: 10000
  #maxPortUDP: 10005

  # STUN servers, you should host your own Coturn instance
  #
  #STUNServers:
  #  - stun:stun.l.google.com:19302
